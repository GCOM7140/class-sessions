# Topic

  - Git and GitHub

# Objectives

  - To show you how to use Git/GitHub in your life as an R-using data
    analyst.
      - For this to happen, we can’t afford to get bogged down in a hot
        mess of Git installation issues. Work through registering a
        GitHub account, installing Git, introducing yourself to Git,
        connecting to GitHub, setting up keys for SSH, connecting
        Rstudio to Git and GitHub, and so on beforehand by completing
        the operations outlined in the chapters of Happy Git and GitHub
        for the UseR listed below.
