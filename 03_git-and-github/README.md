# Topic

* Git and GitHub

# Objectives

* To show you how you can use Git/GitHub in your life as an R-using data
analyst.
   + For this to happen, we can’t afford to get bogged down in a hot mess of Git
   installation issues. Work through registering a GitHub account, installing
   Git, introducing yourself to Git, connecting to GitHub, setting up keys for
   SSH, connecting Rstudio to Git and GitHub, and so on beforehand by completing
   the operations outlined in the chapters of Happy Git and GitHub for the UseR
   listed below.
* To show you how you can submit your homework assignments for this class using
Git/GitHub.
